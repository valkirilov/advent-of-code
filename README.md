# Advent of Code 🎄🌟

Welcome to my Advent of Code journey! 🎉

This cozy little corner of the coding universe is where I'll keep my solutions for the tasks posted by the Advent of Code challenge. Join me on this exciting journey as we tackle coding puzzles and spread some holiday cheer!

## What is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is a yearly coding event that happens in December. Every day from December 1st to December 25th, a new coding puzzle is revealed. These puzzles are designed to test our problem-solving skills and spark our imagination with a touch of holiday magic.
